## Introduction
Classifying flower species is a common problem in machine learning. This project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the species based on various features of the flowers.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of several features representing different attributes of flowers, such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, along with a target variable indicating the species.

## Techniques Used
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A tree-based model used to classify data based on feature values.

## Model Evaluation
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. You can calculate accuracy as follows:

```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, dt_predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

## Visualization
The decision tree is visualized to understand how the model makes decisions based on the input features.

## Conclusion
The Decision Tree Classifier effectively classifies flower species based on their features. Further improvements can be made by tuning hyperparameters or trying other classification algorithms.
